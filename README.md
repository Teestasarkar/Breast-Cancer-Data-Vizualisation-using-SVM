# Breast-Cancer-Data-Vizualisation-using-SVM
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results in a simple and effective machine learning workflow.
